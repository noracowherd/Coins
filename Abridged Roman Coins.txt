A Tradition of Giving


                In Ancient Rome, there were days in the year where the Roman people would be given coins by the Empire in order to keep them from famine and other poverty related issues. This very interesting and often forgotten about practice can be discovered when studying Ancient coins very closely. The symbols and figures on the reverse side of a coin can be quite fascinating when you try to pick apart the meaning. One significant reverse type is one that shows Liberalitas, female personification of liberality, holding cornucopias full of coins. In some iterations she is shown pouring out the coins or holding a ledger book (presumable to distribute them more carefully). This reverse type would be minted to honor the tradition of handing out coins to the citizens. A significant thing to notice about this reverse side is that the cornucopia (which is meant to hold food) is shown holding coins - which further speaks to this coin’s blatant nod to the charitable habits of the empire. Some emperors were more generous than others - such as Marcus Aurelius who minted 10% of the reverse types out there that contain this image during his reign. Looking at the symbols on the reverse type of coins and discovering their true meaning can be an exciting peek into the reality of history.
